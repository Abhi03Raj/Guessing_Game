# Guessing Game (Finite Attempts)

## Description

The Guessing Game is a simple console-based Java application that challenges the player to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The game provides a fixed number of attempts (5) for the player to make the correct guess. After each guess, the program informs the player if their guess is too high or too low, allowing them to adjust their strategy accordingly. If the player successfully guesses the secret number within the allotted attempts, a congratulatory message is displayed. Otherwise, once all attempts are used, the secret number is revealed.

This project is designed to demonstrate core Java programming skills, particularly the use of linear data structures (i.e., arrays for tracking attempts if needed), and basic control structures like loops and ifâ€“else statements. By using Java's built-in `Math.random()` function for number generation and the `Scanner` class for user input, the application emphasizes practical problem-solving and decision-making logic. The simple yet effective design of this game makes it an ideal project for beginners aiming to reinforce their understanding of Java fundamentals while building an interactive application.

## Features

- Randomly generates a secret number between 1 and 100.
- Limits the player to 5 finite attempts.
- Provides real-time feedback ("too low" or "too high") after each guess.
- Displays a winning message if the correct number is guessed.
- Reveals the secret number if the player fails to guess it within the allowed attempts.
- Utilizes straightforward if-else logic and loops for control flow.

## Technologies Used

- Java (JDK)
- Console-based Input/Output (Scanner for input, System.out for output)

## How to Run

1. **Ensure Java is installed on your system.**
2. **Compile the Java source code** by running:
   ```bash
   javac GuessingGame.java
